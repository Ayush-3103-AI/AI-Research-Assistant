"""Public entry point for the Trend & Gap Advisor Service (pipeline stage 0).

Runs the two evidence steps — publication velocity (trend_advisor/velocity.py)
and the cross-paper future-work gap-mining swarm (trend_advisor/gap_mining.py)
— and adapts them to the shared TrendAdvisorResult contract, in the same
progress-events-then-final-result shape as the four existing pipeline
services, so the orchestrator and the advisor CLI can treat this stage
uniformly with the rest.

This stage is optional and strictly additive: nothing in Services 1-4 calls
it, and a normal `researchgenie` run never reaches it.
